## Algorithm Visualiser


### Introduction

This project is a web-based Algorithm Visualizer that helps users understand how different sorting algorithms and data structures work. Through interactive animations, users can see how each algorithm works on a set of data and explore the underlying concepts.

This project was a collaborative effort completed in five days (June 11th - 16th, 2024) to showcase the skills we've acquired through past learning experiences.
